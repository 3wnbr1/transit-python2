transit-python
==============

Transit is a format and set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different programming languages. See
[https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
for details.

transit-python is a Transit encoder/decoder library for Python.

```python
# io can be any Python file descriptor,
# like you would typical use with JSON's load/dump

from transit.writer import Writer
from transit.reader import Reader

writer = Writer("json", io) # or "json-verbose", "msgpack"
writer.write(value)

reader = Reader("json") # or "msgpack"
val = reader.read(io)
```

For example:

```
>>> from transit.writer import Writer
>>> from transit.reader import Reader
>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> io = StringIO()
>>> writer = Writer(io, "json")
>>> writer.write(["abc", 1234567890])
>>> s = io.getvalue()
>>> reader = Reader()
>>> vals = reader.read(StringIO(s))
```

# Typed arrays, lists, and chars

The [transit spec](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
defines several semantic types that map to more general types in Python:

* typed arrays (ints, longs, doubles, floats, bools) map to Python Tuples
* lists map to Python Tuples
* chars map to Strings

When the reader encounters an of these (e.g. <code>{"ints" =>
[1,2,3]}</code>) it delivers just the appropriate object to the app
(e.g. <code>[1,2,3]</code>).

Use a TaggedValue to write these out if it will benefit a consuming
app e.g.:

```python
writer.write(TaggedValue("ints", [1,2,3]))
```

# Supported Python versions

 * 2.7.X

# Development

## Setup

Transit Python requires Transit to be at the same directory level as
transit-python for access to the exemplar files.


## Benchmarks

```sh
python tests/seattle_benchmark.py
```

## Running the examples

```sh
python tests/exemplars_test.py
```

## Build

```sh
pip install -e .
```

The version number is automatically incremented based on the number of commits.
The command below shows what version number will be applied.

```sh
bin/revision
```
